            Hello! My name is Elena Ackovska. I come from Bitola, Republic of
            Macedonia. I am 34 years old. I am married and I have two children.
          </p>
          <p className="about-sub">
            I have graduated at the faculty of law. I also have master of
            political science degree.
          </p>
          <p className="about-desc">
            I switched my carrier in web development because I find it very
            interesting and fun. I took the six-month full stack web development
            course in FOO CODING - Malm√∂, Sweden. I also took some Udemy courses
            to improve and straighten my skills in web development. I don't have
            experience in a software development company, but I do have
            experience in coding by doing some projects by myself.
